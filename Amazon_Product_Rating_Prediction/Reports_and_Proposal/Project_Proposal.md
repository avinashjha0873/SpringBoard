# Amazon Products Rating Prediction
## Introduction
Amazon.com is an American multinational technology company that focuses on e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence. Amazon has millions of products and billions of customers. One of the basic and most influential features of Amazon is that you can give a review about the product you buy. This review plays an important role when you want to buy a product as the product with better reviews is most likely to be purchased. Therefore depending on online reviews has hence become natural for customers.

When looking for a product a customer needs to find useful and credible reviews as fast as possible and comparing text reviews can be a daunting task. So Amazon has 5 stars rating which will give you an overview of the quality of the product with 1 means not that good and 5 meaning really good.

However, many other platforms do not have this rating system. In such cases, it is very important to have a model that could predict the rating of the product using text reviews.

## Aim
The purpose of this project is to develop a model that could predict its rating based on text reviews. While this model is built to work with any kind of product, this project includes reviews from Amazonâ€™s phones and accessories dataset.

I will use Cell Phones and Accessories which is the subset of the entire data set.
