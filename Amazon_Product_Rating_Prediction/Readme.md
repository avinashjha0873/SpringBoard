# Amazon Products Rating Prediction

## Introduction

These days, you can find reviews by users on almost every product or event. Other than offering significant information, these reviews unequivocally sway the purchase choice of users. Numerous shoppers are adequately impacted by online surveys when settling on their buy choices. Depending on online surveys has subsequently become natural for buyers.
When looking for a product a customer needs to find useful and credible reviews as fast as possible and comparing text reviews can be a daunting task. So Amazon has 5 stars rating which will give you an overview of the quality of the product with 1 meaning not that good and 5 meaning really good.

However, many other platforms do not have this rating system. In such cases, it is very important to have a model that could predict the rating of the product using text reviews.

The purpose of this project is to develop a model that could predict its rating based on text reviews. While this model is built to work with any kind of product, this project includes reviews from Amazonâ€™s phones and accessories dataset.
